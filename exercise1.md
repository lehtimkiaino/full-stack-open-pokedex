For this task i will pick up JavaScript as language.

The spesific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of JavaScript are 
checking for security issues of third-party packages, checking for legal issues, checking for outdated dependencies, linting, building and testing, tagging, adding integration tests, running my tests, exporting artifacts and deploying using CI.

The alternatives to set up the CI besides Jenkings and GitHub Actions are GitLab, Atlassian Bamboo, CircleCi, TeamCity, Travis CI, BuildMaster, Bitrise, Spinnaker, UrbanCode, Buddy, Drone.io, AWS CodePipeline, CruiseControl, Integrity, Shippable, CodeShip, BuildKite, GoCD, Semaphore CI, Microtica, AppVeyor, and I am sure there is many more to be found.

I really can't say whether this would be better in self-hosted or cloud-based environment. I would need to try both myself and see the pros and cons of each to say which would be better.
